# Game-of-Life-UI

## Ver 0.5.0
Now the UI is almost done. Still have something to do.

## TO DO
### Library input `Yijun Zhang`
Urgent! generate a 'Welcome' pattern when first open the game.

The library read is on going. I have developed a class with LIF 1.05 version reading.
Please keep going.

### UI `Xibei Zhang`
Known Bugs: The stats is not cleared when restart and shifting modes.

Please add UI to support the lib mode.

### Draw Mode `Xibei Zhang` `Yijun Zhang`
You two can first try how to implement step 1 and 2.

I will help with the draw mode and keep finding some thing interesting.

What do need to do?
1. choose a pattern 
2. get mouse position
3. parse parameter to game().

## Others
String Mode? randomly choose stable or oscili type to construct words.
